Let's deploy to Fly.io. Since the app is working locally, we'll follow these steps:

1. **First, let's verify we're in the correct directory**:
```bash
cd nucleargen/MultiAgent
```

2. **Update the WebSocket connection in agent-ui.js** to use secure WebSocket (wss://) for production:

```javascript:nucleargen/MultiAgent/static/js/agent-ui.js
// WebSocket connection
let ws = null;

// Connect to WebSocket
function connectWebSocket() {
    // Use wss:// in production and ws:// in development
    const protocol = window.location.protocol === 'https:' ? 'wss:' : 'ws:';
    ws = new WebSocket(`${protocol}//${window.location.host}/ws`);
    
    ws.onmessage = function(event) {
        const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
        handleMessage(message);
    };
    
    ws.onclose = function() {
        console.log('WebSocket connection closed');
        setTimeout(connectWebSocket, 1000); // Reconnect after 1 second
    };

    ws.onerror = function(error) {
        console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
    };
}

// Rest of the code remains the same
// ... existing code ...
```
3. **Deploy to Fly.io**:

```bash
# If you haven't already created the app
flyctl launch --generate-name

# If the app already exists, just deploy
flyctl deploy
```

4. **After deployment, check the status**:
```bash
flyctl status
```

5. **Monitor the logs for any issues**:
```bash
flyctl logs
```

6. **Open the app in your browser**:
```bash
flyctl open
```

The app should now be accessible at your Fly.io URL (e.g., https://thrumming-haze-5713.fly.dev/).

Important things to verify after deployment:
1. The UI loads correctly
2. WebSocket connection is established (check browser console)
3. Demo buttons work
4. Messages are being sent and received

Would you like me to help you with any of these steps or verify anything specific?
