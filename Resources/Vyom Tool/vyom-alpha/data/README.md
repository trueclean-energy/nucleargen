# Vyom Data Directory

This directory contains various data files used by the Vyom application.

## Directory Structure

- **inputs/** - Contains original SAPHIRE ZIP files and other input files that need to be processed.
- **examples/** - Contains example and sample files used for documentation, tutorials, testing, and demonstrations.
- **exports/** - Contains exported data files from Vyom processing operations. Files are named with timestamps.
- **visual/** - Contains HTML visualizations generated by the view command.

## File Naming Convention

Files should follow this naming convention:

`[project]_[type]_[date/timestamp].[extension]`

Where:
- `project` is the project identifier (e.g., HTGR_PRA, lwr)
- `type` is the data type (e.g., saphire, openpra, export)
- `date` is the date in YYYYMMDD format
- `timestamp` is the ISO timestamp (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS) for exports
- `extension` is typically json, except for input files which may be zip

Examples: 
- `HTGR_PRA_saphire_20240320.json`
- `HTGR_PRA_export_20240320_143022.json`
- `HTGR_PRA_10162024_Final.zip`

## Version Control

Only small example files should be committed to version control. Larger files or generated exports should be added to `.gitignore`.
